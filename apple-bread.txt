Ingredients:
225 gr. flour
100-125 gr. sugar (Americans might like it sweeter, but for you and me, I think this is enough)
1-2 eggs
100 g butter (or 2 tablespoons butter)
1-2 tablespoons baking powder
3-4 apples (pealed and grated or cut in small pieces)
1 teaspoon vanilla (optional)

Sift flour and baking powder in one bowl, melt butter in a second bowl and add it to the dry previous bowl, mix sugar and egg(s) in the second bowl, then add it to the first. Mix all well. It should be thick, but if it is too hard to mix, you can add a bit of milk. Add the apples. Mix well. Spread on a square mold previously sprayed with oil and then flour so that it doesn't stick.
Bake at 325F (160C) for 50-70 minutes.
